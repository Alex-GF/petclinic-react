# Spring PetClinic Sample Application 

This is a fork of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic to be used for the Pricing4SaaS research. The main changes that have been performed were:

- Trimming several parts of the application to keep the example low
- Redesigned the frontend using React as the main framework

## Understanding the Spring Petclinic application with a few diagrams
<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/michaelisvy/spring-petclinic-sample-application">See the presentation here</a>

## Running petclinic locally
Petclinic is a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot) application built using [Maven](https://spring.io/guides/gs/maven/). You can build a jar file and run it from the command line:


```
git clone https://github.com/isa-group/petclinic-react
cd petclinic-react
mvn -f ./pom.xml clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
java -jar target/petclinic.jar
```

You can then access petclinic here: http://localhost:8080/

Or you can run it from Maven directly using the Spring Boot Maven plugin. If you do this it will pick up changes that you make in the project immediately (changes to Java source files require a compile as well - most people use an IDE for this):

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

## Running petclinic with docker

If you have the docker engine installed on your machine, you can easily run petclinic using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/isa-group/petclinic-react
cd petclinic-react
docker-compose up -d
```

This operation will create a group of three containers:

- A MySQL container that will be used to store the data
- The spring-boot REST API that will take the backend role, and is connected to MySQL
- The React frontend

Once the containers are up and running, you can access petclinic through: http://localhost

## Database configuration

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (H2) which
gets populated at startup with data. 

<!-- ## Working with Petclinic in your IDE

### Prerequisites
The following items should be installed in your system:
* Java 8 or newer.
* git command line tool (https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git)
* Your preferred IDE 
  * Eclipse with the m2e plugin. Note: when m2e is available, there is an m2 icon in `Help -> About` dialog. If m2e is
  not there, just follow the install process here: https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/
  * [Spring Tools Suite](https://spring.io/tools) (STS)
  * IntelliJ IDEA
  * [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) -->

### Steps:

1) On the command line
```
git clone https://github.com/gii-is-DP1/spring-petclinic.git
```
2) Inside Eclipse or STS
```
File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven project
```

Then either build on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources` or using the Eclipse launcher (right click on project and `Run As -> Maven install`) to generate the css. Run the application main method by right clicking on it and choosing `Run As -> Java Application`.

3) Inside IntelliJ IDEA

In the main menu, choose `File -> Open` and select the Petclinic [pom.xml](pom.xml). Click on the `Open` button.

CSS files are generated from the Maven build. You can either build them on the command line `./mvnw generate-resources`
or right click on the `spring-petclinic` project then `Maven -> Generates sources and Update Folders`.

A run configuration named `PetClinicApplication` should have been created for you if you're using a recent Ultimate
version. Otherwise, run the application by right clicking on the `PetClinicApplication` main class and choosing
`Run 'PetClinicApplication'`.

4) Navigate to Petclinic

Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

## Interesting Spring Petclinic branches and forks

The Spring Petclinic master branch in the main [spring-projects](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic)
GitHub org is the "canonical" implementation, currently based on Spring Boot and Thymeleaf. There are
[quite a few forks](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/docs/forks.html) in a special GitHub org
[spring-petclinic](https://github.com/spring-petclinic). If you have a special interest in a different technology stack
that could be used to implement the Pet Clinic then please join the community there.
